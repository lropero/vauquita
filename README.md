- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

### Environment variables

Create `./.env.local` file to modify environment variables locally, this file will take precedence over `./.env` which is intended for production.

### Renaming

1. Change project name in `./package.json` file.
2. Replace all occurrences of `vauquita` to new name in all `.js` and `.jsx` files.
3. Run `npm run nuke`.

You'll now be able to import by doing `import { someComponent } from 'my-amazing-project/components'`, given that `someComponent` was added to `src/components/index.js` accordingly.
